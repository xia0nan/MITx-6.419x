## Part (f) Question 2 (~200 words)

The two panels correspond to consecutive phases 4 → 5. Around this time, the first major seizure occurred and the group pivoted from a marijuana route to a cocaine pipeline. The network contracts and rebalances: the number of edges drops and several peripheral ties disappear, while a new sub‑hub emerges. Centrality shows a marked rise of n12 across all measures (degree, betweenness, eigenvector), consistent with taking over import coordination. n1 remains the dominant broker, with very high betweenness before and after, but its neighborhood becomes more focused on links to the emerging sub‑hub rather than many small spokes. n3 and n83 lose relative prominence as authority shifts toward actors tied to the new logistics. Visually, the left plot shows a star with multiple secondary spokes; the right plot tightens into a hub–subhub shape, with paths funneled through n12. This structural change matches the event narrative: the seizure disrupts the original channel, the organization reassigns roles, and communications reroute through the new import manager.

At a global level the network expands quickly in the first phases, then, after the initial seizure, shrinks and reorganizes, and finally grows to a stable size with intermittent bursts. A persistent core is visible across time: n1 is consistently near the top in both betweenness and eigenvector centrality, indicating long‑run brokerage and core embedding. After the pivot, n12 rises from the periphery to a central coordinator, reflected in a jump in betweenness and eigenvector. n3 oscillates: strong authority in early phases, brief hub behavior mid‑course, then mixed roles. The aggregate trend is: discovery and mapping of the group → shock and reconfiguration → consolidation of a smaller but more efficient core with clearer division of labor. This temporal story is consistent with the background: pressures from enforcement cause the organization to switch commodity and route, which temporarily diffuses ties but then reconcentrates around a few coordinators.

## Part (h) (≤100 words)

Several actors outside the 23 suspects emerge as operationally important in the directed view. Mid‑course hubs include n19 and n20; in later phases n46 and n65 appear as strong broadcasters, and n16 becomes a leading hub while n12 dominates authority. Their prominence suggests control of transportation legs or local distribution nodes, which became critical only after the pivot—hence they were not initially targeted but are influential in the reconfigured network.

## Part (i) (~150 words)

Direction adds role semantics that undirected graphs lose. Out‑degree highlights broadcasters and dispatchers; in‑degree highlights information or resource sinks (accountants, financiers, receivers). Left‑/right‑eigenvector (or hubs/authorities) separate “who points to important nodes” from “who is pointed to by important nodes.” In our data, undirected measures always rate n1 highly, but direction shows phase‑dependent role shifts: early on, n1 acts as a strong hub pushing to authorities; after the pivot, n1 temporarily becomes a major authority (flows point to him); later he resumes hub behavior. n3, by contrast, is largely an authority early on, then briefly turns into a hub during reorganization. These distinctions are essential for inferring command vs. execution roles.

## Part (j) (~300 words)

HITS over time shows clear alternation between issuing and receiving roles. Early phases are hub‑centric around n1; principal authorities include n83, n86 and n3, consistent with a leadership core surrounded by accountants and lieutenants. After the seizure, n1’s hub score stays high while authority mass concentrates on n3 and n85—authority shifting to actors tied to the new channel. In the mid‑course pivot, the pattern flips: hubs include n19, n3, n5 and n76, while n1 becomes the dominant authority, indicating information and coordination flowing toward him. Soon after, n1 again acts as a strong hub, but authority mass disperses to logistics nodes such as n82 and later consolidates around n12 when the cocaine route stabilizes. Tracking n1 and n3 across all phases confirms this: n1 alternates hub → authority → hub, whereas n3 alternates authority → hub → authority. The final phases show new hubs (n16, n65) and a dominant authority (n12), signaling that the organization’s communications end at import control rather than diffuse financial handlers. These role transitions align with the qualitative evolution described earlier and explain why undirected centralities alone cannot capture the operational leadership shifts.
